## Short Bio
I am currently working in ergonomics, human-computer interaction (HCI), ICT convergence, and innovative product/service development domains as an assistant professor in the School of Global Entrepreneurship and Information Communication Technology (GE&ICT) at Handong Global University (HGU) in Pohang, South Korea. I started my academic career in Industrial Design in 2002 at HGU, then studied in Industrial Engineering (specialized in Human Factors and Ergonomics) at Pohang University of Science and Technology (POSTECH). After I received my doctorate in 2013, I worked as post-doctoral research staff for a total of 4.5 years at POSTECH (1.5Y) and Industrial Design Engineering at the Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands (3Y).

With my interdisciplinary perspectives in design, engineering, technologies, and business, my teaching covers broad topics including new product/service development, business startup, user-centered design, UI/UX design, HCI, biomechanics, digital ergonomics, medical/healthcare engineering, and software development. Over the years, through my active participation in research and education works, I've gained academic achievements including 30+ peer-reviewed journal papers, 80+ conference proceedings, 6 patents, 10+ research grants as a PI, 3 academic awards, and so on.

Among the experiences mentioned above, the primary research area that I've most actively worked for the last decade is digital human modeling based on using 3D/4D body scans and engineering design methods for human-friendly products.
