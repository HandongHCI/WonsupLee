## Short Bio
I am currently the CEO of Comfo Labs, Inc. Previously, I served as an associate professor in the School of Global Entrepreneurship and Information Communication Technology (GE&ICT) at Handong Global University (HGU) in Pohang, South Korea, focusing on ergonomics, human-computer interaction (HCI), ICT convergence, and innovative product/service development. My academic journey began with a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Industrial Design at HGU in 2002, followed by further studies in Industrial Engineering with a specialization in Human Factors and Ergonomics at Pohang University of Science and Technology (POSTECH). After earning my doctorate in August 2013, I gained 4.5 years of post-doctoral research experience, working at POSTECH (1.5 years) and in the Department of Industrial Design Engineering at Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands (3 years).

My interdisciplinary expertise spans design, engineering, technology, and business. I have taught a wide range of subjects, including new product/service development, business startups, user-centered design, UI/UX design, HCI, biomechanics, digital ergonomics, medical/healthcare engineering, and software development.

Over the past decade, my primary research focus has been digital human modeling using 3D/4D body scans and engineering design methods for developing human-friendly products. Building on 15 years of research and expertise, I founded Comfo Labs, Inc. in April 2024.
