### Short Bio
I am currently working as an assistant professor in School of Global Entrepreneurship and Information Communication Technology (GE&ICT) at Handong Global University (HGU) in Pohang, South Korea. I started my academic career in Industiral Design in 2002 at HGU, then studied in Industrial Engineering (especially in Human Factors and Ergonomics) at Pohang University of Science and Technology (POSTECH). After I recieved my doctorate in 2013, I worked as a post-doctoral research staff for total of 4.5 years at POSTECH (1.5Y) and Industrial Design Engineering at Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands (3Y).

With my interdisciplinary perspectives in design, engineering, and technologies, Iâ€™ve broadly studied on industrial design and ergonomics topics including new product development, user-centered design, UI/UX design, HCI, service development, sustainable design, biomechanics, digital ergonomics, medical/healthcare engineering, and system development. Over the years, through my active participation in more than 45 research projects, I've gained academic achievements including 30+ peer-reviewed journal papers, 80+ converence proceedings, 6 patents, 2 goverment research grants as a PI, 3 academic awards, and so on.

As shown in the publication list below, my major research area that I've actively worked for the last decade is digital human modeling and engineering design methods using 3D/4D scans. My current research and teaching in HGU cover a broad range of Human Factors and Ergonomics, Human-Computer Interaction, and Human-Centered Product/Service Development.
